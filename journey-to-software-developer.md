### From Silence to Code: Navigating the World of Software Development with a Hearing Impairment

#### Introduction

The journey from an administrative background to the world of software development is a formidable undertaking. When coupled with the daily challenges of living with a hearing impairment, it demands unwavering resilience and determination. It requires profound sacrifice and often casts doubt upon one's capabilities. In this blog, I share my personal journey - from silence to code - detailing the hurdles faced and the accomplishment achieved along the way.

#### The Starting Point

My journey began with a twist of fate. After graduating from high school, I originally set my sights on enrolling in a computer science program, eagerly dive into the world of code & computer. However, fate had a different path in store for me. A well-meaning education counselor provided me with misleading information, leading me to embark on a journey through a diploma in business before ultimately pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science.

This unexpected turn of events led me onto the administrative path, where I found myself immersed in paperwork and office management. Yet, my passion for technology was undeniable, and I was determined to explore it.

#### Challenges and Rejections

Transitioning from an administrative role to a software developer was no easy feat. The rejection emails, each seemingly echoing the doubts I had within, began to accumulate. Some of these rejections were due to my hearing impairment, which added an extra layer of complexity to my job search.  I also faced technical challenges, the learning curve for coding and programming languages often feeling like a mountain I wasn't sure I could climb.

But I didn't give up. With each rejection, I treated it as a valuable lesson and a chance to discover my weaknesses.

#### A Ray of Hope

Amidst the sea of rejections, I found a beacon of hope. One employer saw beyond my challenges and recognized my potential. They were willing to offer me a chance to prove myself in the world of software development. I am incredibly grateful, and this marked a turning point in my journey.

#### The Journey Continues

Other journey continue.

#### Conclusion

As I reflect upon this journey, I can't help but recognize that it's been a path filled with both bitterness and joy. In my 30s, I found myself burdened by an accumulation of negative energy that had quietly taken root during my younger years. It was at this point that I realized it was time to embark on a journey of self-healing.
